# PoetryBot

Twitter bot that posts haiku and prose by hashing together random lines of famous poetry. 

Written in JavaScript with Node.js, running on Heroku. The app uses the following modules: request (for making simple http calls), syllable (for counting the syllables of a string), and twit (Twitter api client). 

If you want to contribute, submit a pull request or issue. 

##Instructions 
Clone the repo and install the dependencies in your project directory.
`$ npm install` 

Replace all `process.env.KEY_NAME` with your own Twitter api keys/tokens/secrets or assign them to environment variables if you deploy your app to Heroku.
